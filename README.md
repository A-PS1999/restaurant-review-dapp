# Restaurant Review Dapp

### Description
A decentralized application which allows users to submit reviews of restaurants, search for reviews by the restaurant's 
name and tip other users if they find their review valuable. The fact that gas fees must be paid in order to submit a 
review discourages spam and low quality reviews. Likewise, the potential to receive an Ethereum tip for a good review also 
serves to incentivize high quality reviews.
